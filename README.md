# smb-scan2
A clone with minor bugfixes for Crypt0s smb-scan
Python-based SMB Share scanner -- scans a bunch of computers, outputs the path and the file permissions for the account

forked from: https://github.com/Crypt0s/smb-scan

Fixed: Doesn't stop on error.
ToDo: Seems to break on non-ASCII characters.

# Dependancies:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysmbc/

# Usage:
Edit the settings in settings.py to be what you want to be. Follow the formatting there. Will output a flat file containing the Unix-style numerical permissions for the user account used

You may specify many targets in the targets.txt file, including networks. Be sure to be classy ;) (192.168.1.0/24, not 192.168.1.1/24)

# Bugs
The file permissions for the file are literally the file permissions for the file -- not for the kind of access your account has to that file -- I'm working on fixing that.

Please report bugs via Here, Twitter (@crypt0s) or gmail (Bryanhalf) Enjoy.
